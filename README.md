   # Quick Guide to DevOps Implementation in the Data Preprocessing Workflow

   This repository applies DevOps principles to automate and streamline a data preprocessing workflow for scraping and processing BBC News website data. Here's a breakdown of how DevOps is utilized and a guide to implementing it:
   # Key DevOps Practices Applied:

1-Automation with Apache Airflow:

An Airflow DAG (bbc_news_dag) automates the daily execution of data extraction and preprocessing tasks, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistency.

2-Version Control with DVC:

Data Version Control (DVC) tracks versions of the preprocessed data stored in CSV files. This ensures reproducibility, collaboration, and rollback capabilities.

3-Code and Workflow Management:

A structured Python script (fetch_and_preprocess_data.py) performs extraction and preprocessing using libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests.
The GitHub repository maintains documentation and code organization, following DevOps best practices for codebase management.

4-Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

The use of Docker simplifies setting up and running Apache Airflow, encapsulating dependencies and ensuring a consistent environment.

# Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing the Workflow:
"Setting up Environmnet

. Install Python and ensure pip is available.

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

.Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

.Run the python script
python fetch_and_preprocess_data.py

.intialzie DVC
dvc init
dvc add preprocessed_data.csv

.Track changes 
git add preprocessed_data.csv.dvc .gitignore
git commit -m "Add preprocessed data with DVC"
dvc push

.automate with apache workflow
docker-compose up


# Conclusion
This workflow demonstrates the effective application of DevOps practices, combining automation, version control, and reproducibility. By integrating Airflow and DVC, the pipeline ensures consistent and scalable data preprocessing.
